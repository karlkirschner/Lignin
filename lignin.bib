  annote    = {This goal of this work was to develop a coarse-grained (CG) model of a β-O-4 type lignin polymer, because of the time consuming process required to achieve equilibrium for its atomistic model. The automatic adjustment method was used to develop the lignin CG model, which enables easy discrimination between chemically-varied polymers. In the process of building the lignin CG model, a sum of n Gaussian functions was obtained by an approximation of the corresponding atomistic potentials derived from a simple Boltzmann inversion of the distributions of the structural parameters. This allowed the establishment of the potential functions of the CG bond stretching and angular bending. To obtain the potential function of the CG dihedral angle, an algorithm similar to a Fourier progression form was employed together with a nonlinear curve-fitting method. The numerical potentials of the nonbonded portion of the lignin CG model were obtained using a potential inversion iterative method derived from the corresponding atomistic nonbonded distributions. The study results showed that the proposed CG model of lignin agreed well with its atomistic model in terms of the distributions of bond lengths, bending angles, dihedral angles and nonbonded distances between the CG beads. The lignin CG model also reproduced the static and dynamic properties of the atomistic model. The results of the comparative evaluation of the two models suggested that the designed lignin CG model was efficient and reliable.},

  abstract = {Lignin is the most abundant natural polymer composed by aromatic moieties. Its chemical composition and its abundance have focused efforts to unlock its potential as a source of aromatic compounds for many years. The lack of a proper way for lignin de-polymerization has hampered its success as a natural solution for commodity aromatic chemicals, which is also due to the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of lignin polymerization. A fuller fundamental understanding of polymerization mechanisms could lead to improvements in de-polymerization strategies, and therefore a proper methodology and a predictive theoretical framework are required for such purpose. This work presents a complete computational study on some of the key steps of lignin polymerization mechanisms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to evaluate the most appropriate methodology and to compute the chemical structures and reaction enthalpies for the monolignol dimerization, the simplest key step that controls the polymerization. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has been applied to understand the coupling reaction mechanisms, for which the radical species and transition states (TSs) involved have been characterized. The coupling that leads to the formation of the $\beta$--O--4 linkage has been theoretically reproduced according to proposed mechanisms, for which weak interactions have been found to play a key role in the arrangement of reactants. The hydrogen bond formed between the oxygen of the phenoxy radical, and the alcohol of the aliphatic chain, together with the interaction between aromatic rings, locates the reactants in a position that favors such $\beta$--O--4 linkage.},

Analysis involving the 3--5{\textasciiacutex} and $\beta$-5{\textasciiacutex} dimers was conducted following the standard procedure, i.e., rotating the monomers around the single bond. On the other hand, analysis of $\alpha$-O-4 and $\beta$-O-4 dimers followed a distinct protocol with the aid of an interesting chemometric tool called Box-Behnken (BB) design. This methodology was applied with the aim of screening the most relevant dihedral angles. The results show that the conformational space for large systems with several dihedral angles can be mapped satisfactorily through the BB approach, reducing the number of dimensions to be treated at the quantum mechanical level. Furthermore, the quantum mechanics-chemometry-quantum mechanics (QM/BB/QM) method proposed here allows us to determine calculated torsional angles for lignin models in good agreement with crystallographic data for some model compounds.},
